# Turn Based Board Game
An online game in which 2 players play each turn to compete. 
## Description
If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins.
During combat, the game works is as follows:
- Each player attacks in turn
- The damage depends on the player's weapon
- The player can choose to attack or defend against the next shot
- If the player chooses to defend themselves, they sustain 50% less damage than normal
- As soon as the life points of a player (initially 100) falls to 0, they lose. A message appears and the game is over.
